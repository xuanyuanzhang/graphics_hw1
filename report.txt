Part 1 follows the instruction.

Here are some specifications on keys that I have modified:

UP: Move camera forward(-z) with its target moving forward as well.
DOWN: Move camera backward(+z) with its target moving back as well.
LEFT: Move camera leftward(-x) with its target moving left as well.
RIGHT: Move camera rightward(+x) with its target moving right as well.
LEFT_BRACKET: Move camera downward(-y) with its target moving down as well.
RIGHT_BRACKET: Move camera upward(+y) with its target moving up as well.

T,Y,U,I,O,P are corresponding keys that move the position of the object. 

2 and 3 scale up and down the item.

4,5,6,7,8,9 are corresponding keys that rotate the object around x, y and z axis on two directions.


Part 2 is a classical 3D maze game. 
The client is initialized at a position in the maze, and the goal is to find the exit.(with a red mark)

User is able to press UP and DOWN to move front or backward, LEFT and RIGHT to turn left or right.
A complete move is considered as either turning for 90 degrees on either left or right, or moving forward or
backward for 1 step. Within a move, user cannot turn to another move.(like when you are moving you cannot 
rotate) After a move is completed, user should press SPACE to ensure that a move has been completed, then moving
on to the next move.
