Part 2 is a classical 3D maze game. 
The client is initialized at a position in the maze, and the goal is to find the exit.(with a red mark)

User is able to press UP and DOWN to move front or backward, LEFT and RIGHT to turn left or right.
A complete move is considered as either turning for 90 degrees on either left or right, or moving forward or
backward for 1 step. Within a move, user cannot turn to another move.(like when you are moving you cannot 
rotate) After a move is completed, user should press SPACE to ensure that a move has been completed, then moving
on to the next move.
